When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    If multiple people are working on the project. This allows for changes from different computers to be visible to all.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Great question.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork is a special tool on github that functions like clone. Clone simply copies a repositories commit history locally to your computer.
  Branches are when you want to work on a new feature while simultaneously keeping the production quality version intact.
